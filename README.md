# appledetection
The aim of this project was to show how it is possible to automatically acquire data from images for interpreting a scene using machine vision and algorithms to count the number of apples present in a photograph. It was required to use an appropriate programming language and relevant machine vision tools and libraries. Features used includes hue, saturation and value, morphological and normal filters, bitwise operations, and Hough Circle Transform. The developed algorithm is able to scroll through a directory of images and count the number of apples present in an image with minimal error.
